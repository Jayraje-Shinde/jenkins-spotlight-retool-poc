Good. Now we shift from building to finishing.

You are no longer experimenting. You are packaging.

Here is the exact roadmap to make this mentor-ready.

✅ Current Status

You have:

Data pipeline (glob + Asciidoctor)

Slug routing

Profile rendering

Fuse search

Sanitization

Basic routing

Missing:

UI modernization (MUI)

Proper error handling

Accessibility polish

Architectural README

Clean project structure polish

2️⃣ Normalize Data Layer

In contributors.ts:

Ensure:

name always string

location always string

intro always string

html always string

No undefined leaking into UI.

This makes your data contract professional.

🎨 Phase 2 — Add Minimal MUI Layout (Half Day)

You don’t need fancy UI.
You need structured UI.

Landing Page:

<Container>

<TextField> instead of raw input

<Grid> for listing

<Card> for each contributor

Make whole card clickable

Profile Page:

<Container>

<Typography variant="h4">

<Divider>

Proper spacing

<Box> wrapping sanitized HTML

This transforms it from “student project” to “real app”.

♿ Phase 3 — Accessibility Pass (1 Hour)

Minimum:

Wrap page content in <main>

Ensure single <h1> per page

Add aria-label to search input

Test tab navigation

Run Lighthouse once

You don’t need perfection.
You need awareness.

🔍 Phase 4 — Slight Search Improvement

Small improvement:

If no results → show “No contributors found”

Debounce not required for POC

Keep it simple

📘 Phase 5 — The README (Most Important)

This is what mentors read first.

Structure:

1. Project Goal

Rebuild Contributor Spotlight using Vite + React.

2. Current Gatsby Replacement Strategy

Explain:

import.meta.glob replaces gatsby-source-filesystem

Asciidoctor replaces gatsby-transformer-asciidoc

Slug generation from filenames

Runtime parsing approach

3. Architecture

Explain layers:

Data layer

UI layer

Routing

Search layer

4. Tradeoffs

Explain:

Runtime parsing vs build-time preprocessing

Why eager glob used for POC

Future plan for build-time script

5. Next Steps

Lazy loading

Build-time JSON generation

Performance optimization

This README is what upgrades you from coder → engineer.

📦 Phase 6 — Repo Cleanliness

Before sharing:

Remove console logs

Clean commit history

No commented garbage

Consistent formatting

Meaningful commit messages
